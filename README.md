# appgyver-video-element

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-player-demo-cx1uxr)

This is a fork of react player altered to pull the url for video from params in url in order to create a solution for appgyver for embedding videos in webview.  The idea is to create a player which can display custom controls and other configurations by passing identifiers in the url params.  I would like to also allow communication between app and the player for counting views and other info.  The only thing we can work with at present is url params in an appgyver webview.
